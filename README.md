# Spaccamient

This is a project striving for a mobile-first [Matrix] client that doesn't compromise on stability or features.  
Tracking code from Element Web's latest stable branch, and adding mobile-specific user experience and performance patches, we can maybe finally achieve the goal of a truly working mobile [Matrix] client.

## Try it

Keep in mind that this project is currently in a very early phase and may go from working perfectly, to being completely broken just an hour later. In any case, feel free to open issues or PRs.  
To simplify and speed up development, we currently only use a single development branch and release in a rolling fashion, as well as keep all parts of our project (even if entirely separate software components) in this single monorepo.
